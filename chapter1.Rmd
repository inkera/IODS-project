# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

In this *course* I look forward to becoming familiar with **version control techniques** and **project tools** through *GitHub* and *R studio*. 

> Nice additions are also:

* R Markdown and creating nice docs with text, code and output.
* Practice my quite limited R coding skills.
